## Description
This repository contains a simple bioinformatics workflow for germline variant calling. The pipeline takes BWA-aligned, sorted, and indexed BAM files as input, runs variant calling using FreeBayes and another variant caller, aggregates the results, and outputs the variants in VCF and table formats.

## Prerequisites
- Google Colab environment
- Internet connection for tool installations and data downloads

## Installation
1. Open the provided notebook in Google Colab.
2. Ensure that all necessary tools are installed within the notebook environment.

## Input Files
- `sample1.bam` and `sample1.bam.bai`
- `sample2.bam` and `sample2.bam.bai`
- `ROI.bed` (Region of Interest)
- GRCh38-p10 reference genome (downloaded during the pipeline run)

## Running the Pipeline
1. Upload the input BAM files and `ROI.bed` to the Colab environment.
2. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the pipeline.
3. The pipeline will perform the following steps:
   - Install necessary tools.
   - Download and prepare the reference genome.
   - Perform variant calling using FreeBayes.
   - Aggregate calls from multiple variant callers (FreeBayes and another tool).
   - Output variants in VCF and table formats.

## Expected Output
- VCF files containing called variants for each sample:
  - `sample1_variants.vcf`
  - `sample2_variants.vcf`
- Table format outputs for each sample's variants.
